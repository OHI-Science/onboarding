## Welcome! 

In this workshop you will learn hands-on how to begin to interoperate between Excel and R. But this workshop is not only about learning R; we will learn R using additional software: RStudio and GitHub. These tools will help us develop good habits for working in a reproducible and collaborative way â€” critical attributes of the modern analyst. 

It's going to be fun and empowering! 

## Why learn R if I know Excel? 

Excel is a widely used and powerful tool for working with data, and it is great for a lot of things. This is convenient and familiar; most of us have had their first experiences with data through Excel or other spreadsheet programs. As Jenny Bryan has said, ["Excel is how we learn that we love data analysis"](). 

Excel is great for data entry. Can also be good for looking at data and feeling like you can touch it, and creating quick exploratory figures.  

Excel can also become problematic with extending to analyses. This is because there aren't firm lines between what is data and what is analyses. For example, in this sheet:

```{r, eval=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/excel-sheet-example.png")
