# Welcome {#welcome}

Hello! This book aims to help you get "on board" with Ocean Health Index (OHI) methods and practices as you lead your own independent OHI assessment (OHI+). 


<!---Note: this roadmap is to help you lead your own OHI+ assessment. Something about OHI-Go https://ohi-science.org/projects/ohi-go/--->

## Learning Roadmap

This book is an annotated learning roadmap for groups that are interested in leading your own OHI+ assessment. It helps orient you to OHI resources and suggests an order that you read and watch them. Most resources are hosted at <http://ohi-science.org>. 

Each chapter begins with information about who should read the chapter. 

We suggest looking through each chapter of this book at the resources available, and creating a learning plan for your timeline. Below is a suggested example. *upcoming*
