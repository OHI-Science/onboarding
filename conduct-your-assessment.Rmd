## Overview

1.  Read [Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160) (Lowndes et al 2017, Nature Ecology & Evolution). This will provide an overview of how we use the OHI Toolbox and why.




The best place to start is with the [OHI Toolbox-training](http://ohi-science.org/toolbox-training/).

The [OHI Manual](https://ohi-science.org/manual/) is a good reference document as well. (A bit of history: this is how the whole ohi-science.org website started; this was originally a PDF created from a Word Doc that we would email to interested groups).
