# Global assessments {#global}

The OHI team at NCEAS leads global OHI assessments annually; we have iterated and refined our approaches since 2012. . The OHI+ guidance in the previous chapters of this book build from our experiences leading global assessments as well as advising OHI+ assessments. While global assessments are much more complex than most OHI+ assessments, global assessment onboarding is included here for reference.
