The best place to start is with the [OHI Toolbox-training](http://ohi-science.org/toolbox-training/).

The [OHI Manual](https://ohi-science.org/manual/) is a good reference document as well. (A bit of history: this is how the whole ohi-science.org website started; this was originally a PDF created from a Word Doc that we would email to interested groups).
