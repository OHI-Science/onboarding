This book aims to help you get “on board” with Ocean Health Index (OHI) methods and practices as you lead your own independent OHI assessment (OHI+). 1.1 Learning Roadmap This book is an annotated learning roadmap for groups that are interested in leading your own OHI+ assessment. It helps orient you to OHI resources and suggests an order that you read and watch them. Most resources are hosted at http://ohi-science.org. Each chapter begins with information about who should read the chapter. We suggest looking through each chapter of this book at the resources available, and creating a learning plan for your timeline. Below is a suggested example. upcoming "],

These steps are are overlapping and iterative: as you plan your assessment you will continue to learn, as you conduct your assessment you will need to modify your plan and keep team members and stakeholders informed. The OHI follows a very structured approach. There are core elements and approaches that you will not change and tailorable elements so that you can fit your needs. It’s important to begin your OHI+ assessment in a way that organized and collaborative, expecting that team members might change and that methods might be revisited. Thus, working like a team and building in resilience from the beginning is critical: focus on documentation and sharing and avoid having only one person who knows or can do something. 2.2 Training: OHI Process Read Best practices for assessing ocean health in multiple contexts using tailorable frameworks (Lowndes et al 2015, PeerJ). This will provide an overview of what’s involved with leading an OHI assessment and what to think about as you begin.
