Hello! This book has onboarding resources for the Ocean Health Index (OHI). It is meant as an annotated learning roadmap for groups that are interested in leading your own OHI+ assessment.

\hypertarget{what-is-this-book}{%
\section{What is this book?}\label{what-is-this-book}}

This book aims to help you get ``on board'' with Ocean Health Index (OHI) methods and practices. There are a lot of moving pieces to leading your own OHI+ assessment and it's important to set yours up in a way that is organized and collaborative, expecting that team members might change and that methods might be revisited. So building in resilience and focusing on documentation and sharing from the beginning is critical.

\hypertarget{learning-roadmap}{%
\section{Learning Roadmap}\label{learning-roadmap}}

This book helps orient you to OHI resources and suggests an order that you read and watch them. Most resources are hosted at \url{http://ohi-science.org}.

We suggest looking through each chapter of this book at the resources available, and creating a learning plan for your timeline. Below is a suggested example. \emph{in progress}

There is a lot to learn about the Ocean Health Index framework in order to best prepare you for leading your own assessment. We recommend reading and watching the following, to start with a broad overview and then get deeper into different aspects of OHI. Then, continue to come back to review these materials throughout your assessment.

The best place to start is with the \href{http://ohi-science.org/toolbox-training/}{OHI Toolbox-training}.

The \href{https://ohi-science.org/manual/}{OHI Manual} is a good reference document as well. (A bit of history: this is how the whole ohi-science.org website started; this was originally a PDF created from a Word Doc that we would email to interested groups).

The OHI team at NCEAS leads global OHI assessments annually; we have iterated and refined our approaches since 2012. . The OHI+ guidance in the previous chapters of this book build from our experiences leading global assessments as well as advising OHI+ assessments. While global assessments are much more complex than most OHI+ assessments, global assessment onboarding is included here for reference.
